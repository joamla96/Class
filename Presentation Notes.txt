Searched the campus, did not find anything.
Sat down, and found a problem.

People cant get proper help when needed.

Idea: IRC / Slack based chat room

 - Stack oveflow
 - Micsoft database
not allways enough

Ask directly and live, when teachers are not available
Community between calsses.

Additional features:
 - From each comment, create threads
 - Ability to upload documents

Like facebook without distractions.

Incentive for people to help
 - Rating system

Test within the class, then extand to other classes.

Connect the classes
People should fall less behind
Meet and talk to other students
