How do PDCA relate to when you are working on a task?

When and how do you plan?
 Before working on the task, thinking about its execution.
 - When we want to implement a change.
 - Gather as much information on the task beforehand.

When and how do you do?
 Actually during the task.
 - Executing your plan
 - Tests the things we changed/implemented

When and how do you check?
 Right after doing the work, making sure the executed task furfills criterias (usually layed out in planning stage)
 - Compare before and now, check if you furfill the cirterias
 - Review the tests, analyse the results, and identify what we learned about the task.

When and how do you act?
 After the check, think about how to better meet all criterias.
 - Check if it's better/worse than before, analyse, and check what could be done better
 - Like planning, but not planning the task, but planning what to do better
 - Take action, based on what as learned in the check, ensure the change worked.
